# LeetCodeProblems
This repo contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, with comments so everyone can understand my thought process and logic. The solutions file will contain the optimal solution, plus any other different method that I came up with that differs from the published LeetCode solution. I have set up a script that will automatically update the markdown file with each problem I solve, so please check back frequently if you cannot find any problems. As of now, I have decided to go through the easy problems one by one, then move on to the medium and then the hard ones.
